# Field Discovery Enhancement Proposal

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive enhancement to the Finviz MCP Server to enable dynamic field discovery capabilities for MCP clients. Currently, users must know field names in advance, which creates a poor developer experience and limits the server's usability.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **No field enumeration**: MCP clients cannot programmatically discover available fields
- **No field documentation**: No descriptions of what each field contains
- **Manual field specification**: Users must refer to external documentation or source code
- **No schema discovery**: No way to understand field types, formats, or categories
- **Error-prone field usage**: Invalid field names result in runtime errors

### User Pain Points
1. **Discovery friction**: New users struggle to understand available data fields
2. **Documentation dependency**: Users must consult external documentation
3. **Trial-and-error approach**: Invalid field names lead to failed requests
4. **Limited introspection**: No way to explore data capabilities programmatically

## Proposed Solution

### New MCP Tools for Field Discovery

#### 1. `list_available_fields`
**Purpose**: Enumerate all available data fields

```python
@server.tool()
def list_available_fields() -> List[TextContent]:
    """
    List all available data fields for stock fundamentals.
    
    Returns:
        Complete list of field names that can be used with 
        get_stock_fundamentals and get_multiple_stocks_fundamentals
    """
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Available Data Fields (128 total):

Basic Information:
- ticker: Stock ticker symbol
- company: Company name
- sector: Business sector
- industry: Industry classification
- country: Country of incorporation

Valuation Metrics:
- pe_ratio: Price-to-Earnings ratio
- pb_ratio: Price-to-Book ratio
- dividend_yield: Annual dividend yield percentage
- payout_ratio: Dividend payout ratio
...

[Complete field listing with brief descriptions]
```

#### 2. `get_field_categories`
**Purpose**: Organize fields by functional categories

```python
@server.tool()
def get_field_categories() -> List[TextContent]:
    """
    Get available data fields organized by category.
    
    Returns:
        Fields grouped by functionality (valuation, performance, 
        technical, fundamental, etc.)
    """
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Field Categories:

üìä BASIC INFORMATION (8 fields)
- ticker, company, sector, industry, country, exchange, market_cap, employees

üí∞ VALUATION METRICS (12 fields)  
- pe_ratio, pb_ratio, ps_ratio, peg_ratio, dividend_yield, payout_ratio, ...

üìà PERFORMANCE METRICS (18 fields)

üéØ TRADING DATA (12 fields)
- volume, avg_volume, float, short_interest, option_volume, ...
```

#### 3. `describe_field`
**Purpose**: Get detailed information about specific fields

```python
@server.tool()
def describe_field(field_name: str) -> List[TextContent]:
    """
    Get detailed description and metadata for a specific field.
    
    Args:
        field_name: The field name to describe
        
    Returns:
        Detailed field information including description, data type,
        format, and usage examples
    """
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Field Description: pe_ratio

üìã Basic Info:
- Name: pe_ratio
- Display Name: Price-to-Earnings Ratio
- Category: Valuation Metrics
- Data Type: Float

üìñ Description:
The Price-to-Earnings ratio measures a company's current share price 
relative to its per-share earnings. It indicates how much investors 
are willing to pay per dollar of earnings.

üìä Format:
- Unit: Ratio (e.g., 15.5 means 15.5x earnings)
- Precision: 2 decimal places
- Special Values: N/A for companies with negative earnings

üí° Usage Examples:
- Low P/E (< 15): Potentially undervalued or slow growth
- High P/E (> 25): Growth expectations or overvaluation
- N/A: Company has negative earnings

üîó Related Fields:
- forward_pe: Forward P/E ratio based on estimated earnings
- peg_ratio: P/E ratio adjusted for growth rate
- eps_ttm: Trailing twelve months earnings per share
```

#### 4. `search_fields`
**Purpose**: Search fields by keyword or pattern

```python
@server.tool()
def search_fields(keyword: str, category: Optional[str] = None) -> List[TextContent]:
    """
    Search for fields matching a keyword or pattern.
    
    Args:
        keyword: Search term (e.g., "growth", "ratio", "performance")
        category: Optional category filter
        
    Returns:
        Matching fields with descriptions
    """
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Search Results for "growth":

üìà GROWTH-RELATED FIELDS (8 matches):

eps_growth_qtr
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EPS Growth Quarter over Quarter (%)

eps_growth_this_y  
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EPS Growth This Year (%)

eps_growth_next_y
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EPS Growth Next Year Estimate (%)

eps_growth_past_5y
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EPS Growth Past 5 Years (Annual %)

sales_growth_qtr
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sales Growth Quarter over Quarter (%)

sales_growth_past_5y
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Sales Growth Past 5 Years (Annual %)

dividend_growth_1_year
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dividend Growth Rate (1 Year %)

dividend_growth_5_years
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Dividend Growth Rate (5 Years %)
```

#### 5. `validate_fields`
**Purpose**: Validate field names before use

```python
@server.tool()
def validate_fields(field_names: List[str]) -> List[TextContent]:
    """
    Validate a list of field names and suggest corrections.
    
    Args:
        field_names: List of field names to validate
        
    Returns:
        Validation results with suggestions for invalid fields
    """
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Field Validation Results:

‚úÖ VALID FIELDS (6):
- ticker
- company  
- pe_ratio
- dividend_yield
- market_cap
- sector

‚ùå INVALID FIELDS (2):
- eps_yoy ‚Üí Did you mean: eps_growth_this_y?
- sales_growth_yoy ‚Üí Did you mean: sales_growth_past_5y?

üí° SUGGESTIONS:
For yearly growth metrics, use:
- eps_growth_this_y (current year EPS growth)
- eps_growth_past_5y (5-year average EPS growth)
- sales_growth_past_5y (5-year average sales growth)
```
